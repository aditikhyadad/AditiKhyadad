What is the projrect about? 
This code is for a carpooling application. It allows people to register either as drivers or passengers. 

a)If you register as a driver, you provide your details such as name, age, car number, and the route you will be driving. 
You also specify the number of available seats in your car and the price per kilometer. 

b)If you register as a passenger, you provide your details such as name, age, and the route you want to travel. 
You also specify the number of passengers traveling with you. 
Once passengers register, the application displays the available rides that match their route. 

It checks if there are drivers who are going in the same direction, have available seats, and their prices are acceptable. 
If there are suitable rides, it displays the driver's details and asks the passenger to confirm the ride. 
If the passenger confirms the ride, the application reduces the number of available seats in the driver's car and confirms the ride. 
If there are no suitable rides available, it informs the passenger that no rides are currently available. 

The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
